# Homework1 - Introduce a New NN with Memory 
Please complete each homework for each team, and <br>
mention who contributed which parts in your report.

# Motivation
NN with Memory can potentially to be used to acompplish many AI related tasks: Reasoning, Decision Making, etc. <br>
Here are some related talks:<br>

# To-Do
* [+10] Please find a recent paper (2014-2015) which introduced a NN with memory.
* [+50] Write a report to briefly introduce the paper;
* [+40] then, focus on discussing the unique properties of the new NN and where it can be applied to take advantage of the properties.
* c_t^j=f_t^j c_(t-1)^j+i_t^j c ̃_t^j
